      Every technology out there goes through the hype cycle. Everyone jumps onto it and wants to have impressive headlines which is why we inflate expectations. After a while we always realise that reality is not all rainbows and unicorns and the pendulum swings the other way. In the end we get to take the technology serious and see how it can be used productively. All of this is frustrating to techies but this is how marketing works. Just building something is not enough - you need to sell it, too.

      One of the barriers of HTML5 is hand-made. For years we've been trying to chase the dream of building one thing and make it behave the same everywhere. Instead of embracing the idea that anything on the web can make workable and then enhanced to be more comfortable for better and newer environments, we tried to shoehorn everything new into an existing outdated infrastructure.

      I could bore you now with numbers and projections showing that more and more mobile devices are being sold. That's neither here nor there for us as developers as all of those are fleeting and can change in months. The thing we have to worry about though is that the mobile platform as it is now is not as open to web technologies as it was heralded when people declared Flash dead.

      Fact is that we don't get access to all the hardware parts that make a smartphone interesting. In order to do that we need to package our HTML5 apps in a native wrapper and the performance of these wrappers is worse than those of the browser on these platforms. This lock-out is holding HTML5 back.

    <footer class="notes">
      The next issue HTML5 has to face is one of perception. The closed platforms have users conditioned that apps can be found in app stores and that it is easy to pay for them there and get upgrades from there. Regardless of what we might be thinking about these stores, people want them - right now.

    <footer class="notes">
      Some of the failed attempts at selling HTML5 as an app platform are based on the approach we took. A lot of it is simulating what native platforms do rather than taking advantage of what the web can bring to the equation.

      (Explanation of the picture: during the prohibition in the US moonshiners - people brewing alcohol illegaly - wore these shoes so their tracks look like cow tracks)

        Another big thing I am very excited about are web components, which define the missing app widgets we need, X-Tag which makes those available cross-browser and the Mortar and Webgame stub systems. Both of those allow any developer to start an app or game from building blocks and with a deployment script that uses GitHub as the host. They even create the offline and app manifests for you.
